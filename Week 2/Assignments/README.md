## Assignment
#### Linear Regression
  - Implement Linear Regression using Gradient Descent from scratch on dataset provided in the given folder.
  - You need to predict the performance index of students based on other attributes.
  - You need to implement the model from scratch just using numpy for building the model, you can use any other library for data manipulation and visualization (prepossessing).
  - Use first 90% of the data for training and the remaining 10% for testing.
  - Report RMSE on the test data for model evaluation (you can use any library for this)
  - Your goal is to RSME as low as possible, so try to experiment with all the concepts you have learned till now.
  - Implement the code in .ipynb file and submit it
#### Logistic Regression
  - Implement Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent from scratch on dataset provided in the given folder.
  - You need to predict whether the last column is 1 or 0 based on other attributes.
  - You need to implement the model from scratch just using numpy for building the model, you can use any other library for data manipulation and visualization (prepossessing).
  - Use first 90% of the data for training and the remaining 10% for testing.
  - Report accuracy of your model (percentage of data points classified correctly) along with the confusion matrix.
  - Implement the code in .ipynb file and submit it
