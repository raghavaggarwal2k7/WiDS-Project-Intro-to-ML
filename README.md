# Intro-to-ML_WIDS

This Winter in Data Science Project under the Analytics Club is being mentored by [Kushagra](https://github.com/Kushagra-o7) and [Saksham](https://github.com/PsychoX21)

## Contents

-   Week-1 : Basics of Python and required libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas
-   Week-2 : Implementing Gradient Descent, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and other related concepts
-   Will be Updated Later

Resources and assignments will be uploaded to the corresponding week's folders

## Project Policies

-   This Project will serve as a foundation for most of ML projects you will be doing later, hence put efforts in learning the concepts rather than the implementation itself
-   Throughout the course of this project you will be learning lots of things through reading, watching videos or through assignments, so in case of any doubt try to google and find answer yourself. Still if you weren't able to figure out yourself, feel free to reach out to any of us
-   We strictly encourage you not to use ChatGPT or any other AI tool, use Google and other resources like Documentation, Geeks for Geeks, w3schools, Stack Overflow etc, as they tell you not only your doubt but also lots of different things in that concept
