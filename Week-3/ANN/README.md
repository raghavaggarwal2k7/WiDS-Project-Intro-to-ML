## New York Air Quality 

The goal of this assignment is to preprocess the dataset and build an optimal Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts air quality metrics using the dataset provided.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Splitting
- Separate the dataset into **train**, **validation**, and **test** sets.
  - Use an appropriate ratio, e.g., 70% train, 15% validation, and 15% test.
  - Ensure the splitting process is random.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Convert all features into **numerical format**:
  - Handle categorical data using encoding techniques like **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding**.
  
- Drop missing or invalid values in the dataset.

### 3. Model Building
- Create a **Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model using TensorFlow.
- Optimize the model architecture:
  - Experiment with the number of layers and neurons.
  - Use **activation functions** like ReLU or Sigmoid.
  

### 4. Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using:
  - **Accuracy i.e %correctly classified**


### 5. Optimization
- Iterate and improve the model to improve the accuracy
- Report the final performance metrics.


### Implement the code in .ipynb file and submit it
