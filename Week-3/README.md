## **Neural Networks**

This week, we will be learning **Artifical Neural Networks** with dense layers and later dive into **Convolutional Neural Networks**

Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of interconnected layers that process and learn from data. Many different types of architecture have been developed to solve various ranges of problems. One of them is Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), a powerful and widely used deep learning technique for image classification and processing. CNNs are a cornerstone of computer vision and have a wide range of applications in various domains.

### **Learning Resources**
-   Start with this 3B1B playlist that will help build the intuition behind the ANN https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi
-   Watch all videos of this playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU&feature=shared.
-   To gain a more intuitive understanding on CNN too, explore this https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1sQgSTcAaT7MbcLWacjsqoOQvqzMdUWg&feature=shared, which offers excellent visualizations of CNN concepts and operations.

### Note:
-   Some concepts may be repeated in the deeplizard playlist from previous weeks , you can skip that.
-   Also there may be some syntactic updates from the syntax shown in the videos in the new version of libraries.

### Assignments:
-   Both folders, **ANN** and **CNN**, contains this week assignment and their instruction
