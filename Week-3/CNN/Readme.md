## MNIST Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)


The goal of this assignment involves utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict outcomes on the MNIST dataset. The task requires performing data preprocessing, including one-hot encoding, and then implementing a CNN model. The objective is to measure the model's accuracy and analyze the impact of Dropout layers by comparing the model's performance with and without their use

The dataset will be automatically downloaded upon executing the provided notebook. After completing the dataset preprocessing, proceed to build the CNN model as outlined. The notebook is to be submitted for final submission.
